Homepage needs cleaning up.
- Should look impressive. First page user sees.
Billing Page
- Add fields for billing address
- Add reserve option
User Profile
- Separate information with tabs. Don't put all on one page.
- Same with edit profile page.
Admin Page
- Separate types of info into tabs (i.e. orders, users, books)
